## <span style = "font-size: 28px;"> Linux Namespace Performance </span>

<p class = "style1">
    This project was created for ASRC Federal Mission Solutions (AFMS)

    <br/><br/>

    Part of a 6 man team tasked to develop a tool to measure the speed of Linux Interprocess Communications (IPCs). The project was created using C to make system calls to run these IPCs and Python was used to create a GUI to allow user selection and to visualize the data and compare them against each other. This project was developed through Agile Software Development.

    Some libraries that were used are the SYSV and POSIX libraries in UNIX to make system calls done in C, and the libraries matplotlib, pandas, and seaborn were used to create images and graphs to show the runtime of each IPC.
